## Technical Achievements
- Added a form and a rescale option to the D3 graph for a user to be able to update the graph if they want to
- I used selectAll() and .remove() in order to get rid of the elements before replacing
- Used html elements like checkboxes and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator to get the selected species data
- Had to keep track of orignal data and individual species data, the original data still was need to caluclate the cirlce sizes which needed all the species. This was so the circle sizes where standard no matter the graph. 
- The indicidual species data was used in order to know what points needed to be put on the graph.
- Also there was a speciesData variable which was used for rescaling purposes and could be different from the original data if needed.
- Added a rescale option if the user wants to rescale the graph based on the species inputs.

## Design Achievements
- use CSS to style the checkboxes I made for the technical achievement in order for it to look more visually appealing
- I referenced this to do it https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_custom_checkbox.asp 
- I then changed fields and made the update button blue in order to understand what was happening more
